# SO Multi Agente Features

This document summarizes the main product capabilities in the public desktop app.

## Workspace

- Open multiple projects at the same time.
- Render opened projects as containers in the workspace.
- Close containers without killing their PTYs.
- Collapse containers into compact headers.
- Put one container in fullscreen.
- Use flat mode to combine panes from multiple projects.
- Reorder containers and panes with drag and drop.
- Restore opened containers and recent tabs across restarts.

## Layouts

SO Multi Agente supports layouts at project, group, and workspace level.

- **Auto**: one pane full size, two panes side by side, three or more in a grid.
- **Spotlight**: one primary pane with secondary panes stacked beside it.
- **Sidebar**: a narrow pane list with one larger active pane.
- **Custom grid**: visual editor for columns, rows, spans, and proportions.

Custom grids support `colSpan`, `rowSpan`, drag-and-drop swapping, and resizable row/column fractions.

## Terminals and PTYs

- Real backend PTYs through `portable-pty`.
- Shell, Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode terminal types.

- In-terminal search.
- Native copy/paste behavior.
- Prompt history per terminal.

## Terminal Sub-Tabs

- Multiple sub-tabs inside one terminal pane.

## Search and Navigation

- Jump modal for terminals.
- Filter by project name, terminal name, and cwd.
- Keyboard navigation with arrows and Enter.
- Keyboard shortcuts:

  On macOS, `Ctrl` is read as `Cmd` (`e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey`), so the table
  below is the same on both platforms. Most shortcuts are ignored while focus
  is in an editable field; `Esc`, zoom, and the `Ctrl`-prefixed shortcuts are
  the exceptions.

  | Shortcut | Action |
  | --- | --- |
  | `Ctrl+T` | Open the new-terminal modal |
  | `Ctrl+Shift+T` | Reopen the last closed tab |
  | `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Add a Markdown or browser pane |
  | `Ctrl+W` | Close/hide the first pane in the active container |
  | `Ctrl+P` | Find/jump |
  | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | New project |
  | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | New group |
  | `Ctrl+Shift+H` | Toggle between Home and the workspace |
  | `Ctrl+1` … `Ctrl+9` | Jump to the Nth project in sidebar order |
  | `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` | Navigate persistent workspace history |
  | `Shift+Tab` | Focus the next terminal in the current group/project |
  | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Cycle project tabs without reordering them |
  | `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+0` | UI zoom in, out, reset (numpad variants included) |
  | `R` | Restart the selected terminal when focus is on the UI, not inside the terminal |
  | `Esc` | Close the open modal, or leave fullscreen |

## System Integration

- Custom title bar.
- Open cwd in the system file explorer.
- Open cwd in VS Code.

## Backup

- Export local state as a `.zip`.
- Include `projects.json` and scrollback files.
- Import backup by replacing local state.
- Protect against zip-slip during import.
- Use atomic project-file writes to reduce corruption risk.

## Spotify

- User-provided Spotify Client ID and Client Secret.
- Local token persistence and automatic refresh.

## Agent Planning

Agent Planning / Agent Canvas is experimental. It provides a visual control surface for coordinating agent sessions and workers from inside SO Multi Agente.
